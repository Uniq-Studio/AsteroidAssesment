# Asteroid Assessment

## Project Overview 
In this project, we are building a game that plays like Asteroids with our own spin on it for our Graded Unit, alongside other tasks. We were challenged to create this game within unity with the core coding concepts we learnt.

In this project, we will cover the following topics:
- **Arrays**
- **Unity Instantiate**
- **Sound**
- **Player Input**
- **Keeping Score and Health**
- **Multiple Scenes**

Assets used by **Jordyn**.

Check the **Releases** for the final project.

This Project is now closed!
